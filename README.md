# Python-RaspberryPi
Simple Python Script with Raspberry Pi - Video Demo in repo

This was a simple project for me to practice python and working with Raspberry Pi.
One of the most challenging parts was the logic for the button to have the light alternate between green and red bassed on pressing it. 
I accomplished this by having two while loops inside one while loop, with two variables. 

I'm not sure if this was the best way to do it but I got it working this way. I do wonder if there is a cleaner way to produce the same 
effect?
